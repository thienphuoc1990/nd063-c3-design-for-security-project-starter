Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway - UDP
2. IAM policy is allowing full access to resources. 
2. The use of a non-root account is not enforced.
3. CloudTrail Trail is not specified.
5. VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic which violates the AWS recommendation.
6. TCP port 5000, 22 is reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance.
7. Server-side encryption and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. MFA should be enabled for the root user
2. Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
3. CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
4. EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
5. Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
6. VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic
7. Limit the traffic on the Security Groups only allow 80 as well as reference the other security group for accessing AWS resource within VPC.
8. Disable all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance.
9 Enable S3 server-side encryption and logging
