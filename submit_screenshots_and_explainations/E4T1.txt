# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- Remove SSH Vulnerability on the Application Instance
- Restrict network traffic that can reach the application server
- Allow SSH only for users with specific roles.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Use least privilege access for the existing instance role profile to only allow access to specific buckets rather than using a wildcard selector. 
- Enable server-side encryption on the S3 buckets
- Least Privilege Access to S3
