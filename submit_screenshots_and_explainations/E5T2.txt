1. Regula: https://github.com/fugue/regula
2. Terrascan: https://github.com/accurics/terrascan
3. Chef Inspect: https://github.com/inspec/inspec


### Example vulnerability
1. Server Side Encryption (SSE) not enabled

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
1. AWS Config
2. AWS Inspector
